# This Docker Compose file allows you to run both the application and its PostgreSQL database
# with a single command (`docker-compose up`). It defines the services, environment variables,
# health checks, volumes, and networking (using Docker's default network) that you would
# otherwise configure manually on hosting platforms like Vercel, Railway, AWS, or Azure.
